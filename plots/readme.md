### Plot notes ###

We changed from 6 figures to 7 figures late in the analysis 
(adding our current figure 4, which was part of figure 3 in previous versions). We haven't
updated the directory names, so 4 maps to 5, 5 to 6, and 6 to 7.

#### Contents ####

A quick rundown of the contents:

allReads_only_readplot - for making the figure 7a allele plots from a simple list of events + counts
auto_gen_HMID_drawings	- also for the same purpose?  I have to go clean out one of these...
figure_1	- the D3 plots for the histograms of indels
figure_3	- most of the figure 3 plots, besides part A
figure_4	- actually figure 5 plots
figure_6	- the figure 7 plots
phylogeny	- D3 code for making the trees
read_plot	- the 3-way plots of allele count, with insertions, deletions, and abundances.  We autogen these for all samples
square_tree	- an old representation with square edges, many problems
